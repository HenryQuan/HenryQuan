Currently, I am focusing on my automated trading system (codename: NAIVE) in 2025 with Python, PyTorch and other frameworks. The results are promising so far, but it is not yet profitable as of 2025. For any business inquiries, please contact me via [email](mailto:development.henryquan@gmail.com). Unfortunately, I may not have any additional time for anything else unless the offer is extremely good.
